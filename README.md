# Deathrun-Zones-DRZones-
This plugin allows you to prevent the terrorist from leaving his base by adding one or more special zones on specific places. When the terrorist steps in that zone, he is teleported back to spawn. The zones are automatically saved in the file data/DRZones/mapname.txt. This plugin can also be used in every mod, by changing the cvar "drzone_global" to "1".
